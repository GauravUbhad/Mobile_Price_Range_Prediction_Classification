# Project Summary

This project aims to study a dataset containing details about mobile phones, like battery power, camera quality, and screen size, to create a model that can predict whether a phone is low-priced, medium-priced, high-priced, or very high-priced.

The project involves several steps:

•	Data Wrangling : First, we'll clean up the data by dealing with missing information and correcting some errors. For example, we'll replace incorrect zero values in pixel resolution and screen width with the average values to make the data more accurate.

•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) : Next, we'll explore the data to understand how different phone features are related to their price range. We want to find patterns and connections between variables like battery size, RAM, and camera quality.

•	Hypothesis Testing : We'll use statistical tests to verify our ideas and identify which factors are truly important. We'll also handle any unusual data points that could affect our predictions.

•	Feature Engineering : We might come up with new features or change existing ones to make our prediction model better. We'll pick the most important features that help us predict the price range effectively.

•	Machine Learning Models: Finally, we'll use machine learning techniques to build our prediction model. We'll try different algorithms like logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost to see which one works best. We'll also fine-tune the model to make it as accurate as possible.

# Problem Statement

In the fiercely competitive mobile phone industry, companies seek to gain insights into both sales performance and the key determinants of pricing. The primary aim is to uncover correlations between various features of a mobile phone, such as RAM, internal memory, and others, and the corresponding selling price. Rather than predicting the exact price, the goal is to establish a relationship that categorizes price ranges, indicating the level of pricing competitiveness.

# Conclusion

In this project, we used data about mobile phones to figure out what makes their prices go up or down. We looked at things like how much RAM they have, their battery power, and the quality of their screens.
We were able to create a computer program that can predict the price range of a phone. It can tell whether a phone is cheap, not-so-cheap, a bit expensive, or very expensive, based on these factors.
What we found is that things like having more RAM, a bigger battery, and a better screen quality tend to make phones more expensive. These are the key factors that influence how much a phone costs.
This project can help phone companies make better decisions about how to price their products and understand what features are most important to customers when it comes to choosing a phone.
